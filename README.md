## About Me

I'm a middle school student from Jiangsu Province, China. <br>
I love programming a lot and mainly work on game development and .NET applications, so my favorite programming languages are C# and GDScript. <br>
I do my development work and solve problems with Windows OS to use Visual Studio, which is the best IDE in world now by Microsoft. <br>
Besides GDScript and C#, I also write C++, Java and Python. <br>
